# Below python script is useful to create simple REST api using flask. this API will receive the name as the input and return the same as output
# steps as below:

#Flask and Flask-RESTful are installed using pip install command

# Flask class is imported from flask module
from flask import Flask

# Resource, Api classes imported from flask_restful module inorder to create the first rest api
from flask_restful import Resource, Api

# Flask application instance is created using below command
app = Flask(__name__)

#Api application instance is created using below command
api = Api(app)

#In general API works with resources and resoruces should be defined as class. Student is created as Resource class and
# definited to return the value as student:'input value'
class Student(Resource):
    def get(self, name):
        return {'student': name}

# Configured newly created resource Student accessible throuugh API
api.add_resource(Student, '/student/<string:name>')

# runt the application
